An attacker could use a SQL injection to steal or modify contents of the database. Instead, use a parameterized query which is available by default in most database engines. Alternatively, consider using an object-relational mapper (ORM) such as Sequelize which will protect your queries."

    "issue_text": "The application processes user-input, this is passed to res.sendFile which can allow an attacker to arbitrarily read files on the system through path traversal. It is recommended to perform input validation in addition to canonicalizing the path. This allows you to validate the path against the intended directory it should be accessing."
